        <p>
            Portland International Airport (PDX) has some varied interests for the aviation geek, or "avgeek".
            Being located in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) invites comparison
            to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA).
            Seattle is the headquarters hub of Alaska Airlines and its regional subsidiary Horizon.
            But Portland is also a secondary hub for Alaska and Horizon.
        </p>

        <p>
            Seattle has far more international routes than Portland.
            Portland has enough to be interesting.
        </p>

        <p>
            But PDX is also a mixed-use civilian/military airport with the Portland Air National Guard Base
            on the south side of the airfield.
            None of the Seattle-area airports is mixed-use.
        </p>

        <p>
            Another interesting aspect of Portland for aviation geeks is that it has a Boeing paint hangar.
            Of course, Seattle dominates that aspect because Boeing Commercial Airplanes has two major factories there:
            widebody jets at Everett's Paine Field (PAE) and narrowbody jets at Renton Municipal Airport (RNT).
            Both those airports have paint hangars. But they aren't enough to keep up with current plane production.
            So some planes get flown out unpainted, with a green vinyl protective coating, to get painted
            at either Boeing Field (BFI) in Seattle or Portland PDX.
            There is no Boeing paint hangar at Seattle-Tacoma SEA.
            So this adds to the interesting mix for planespotting in Portland.
        </p>

        <p>
        I've found that bicycling has advantages for planespotting at PDX Airport.
        Airports of course are busy places with limited parking.
        Some good spots at PDX are only easily accessible by bicycle.
        I'll share my experiences here on getting to the airport and where the viewing spots are.
        </p>

        <p>
        Though pedestrians can access all the points too, if you take transit or find a place to park. 
        It's just a lot slower.
        </p>

        <h2><a name="getting-to-pdx">Getting to PDX</a></h2>
        <p>
            Planespotters have options to get to PDX by car, transit or bicycle.
            Some locations are only really accessible by bicycle.
            I'll lump scooters in with bicycles since they can usually use the same routes.
            Rental bikes and scooters have geofenced boundaries which may not access the whole area.
        </p>

        <p>
        Portland Airport can be reached from most directions, some more or less direct than others.
        Generally, it's best to stick to bike paths and roads with bike lanes.
        Avoid or use extreme caution on roads which have no bike facilities.
        </p>
